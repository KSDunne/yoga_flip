## Purpose of the project

Yoga Flip is a version of the classic card memory game. It provides value to a user of any age through an educational aspect. The educational aspect is that the game gives the name of the yoga pose shown on the cards, after each successful match. Therefore, the user is learning the name of each yoga pose as they are playing the game. The game is also challenging, because the player is playing against a countdown timer. When the timer reaches zero the grid playing area fades away and a 'Time Out!' slogan appears. There are also social links in the footer of the main game page to encourage the user to connect with a yoga studio business, which offers in-person classes. The color theme of yoga flip was specifically chosen to provide feel-good and energizing emotions. Bright anchor colors were chosen. These are; purple, yellow, light pink, bright pink and bright green. These colors were also inspired by accessible color palettes. The whole theme of this project is based around energising Vinyasa yoga.

- Make a game that provides value to the user through an educational aspect
- Make a game that lets the user initiate the countdown timer and gives feedback through the display of each yoga pose name, when cards are successfully matched
- Make the game responsive on multiple screen sizes
- Use a defensive design
- Show the user is making progress when they play the game a couple of times, through the use of local storage

## User stories

- As a site visitor, I am first assessing if this is an intuitive and eye-catching game that I would like to play
- As a site visitor, I will initially see a grid style game with 16 cards.
- As a site visitor, I will initially be able to see the back-side of the cards
- As a site visitor, I will see that the timer starts when I flip the first card
- As a site visitor, I will be able to click two cards at a time. They will flip over and stay flipped over if I have matched them
- As a site visitor, I will see that a move is logged when the second card is flipped
- As a site visitor, I will see that the countdown timer stops once I finish matching all of the 16 cards on the grid
- As a site visitor, I will be able to click a button that says "rules" and the rules of the game will pop up. This will pop up via a modal
- As a site visitor, I will be able to close this modal whenever I want and return to where I was in the game
- As a site visitor, I will be able to click a "reset" button at any time during the game
- As a site visitor, I will make use of the defensive design in the reset button by confirming what I would like to do, whether that is continue playing the game I was playing or reset all cards, timer and current moves
- As a site visitor, I will be able to see links in the footer to social media, where I can search for yoga studios if I would like to do that. This will encourage me to a local yoga studio for in-person lessons
- As a site visitor, I will get feeback when the countdown timer reaches zero and I will get feed back when I win a game. Both of these feedback mechanisms will be animations
- As a site visitor, I can see the max amount of moves I made in the last few times I played the game through local storage and I can compare this number to my current move number
- Overall, as a site visitor, the value I get from this site is; I have fun, I am challenged by the countdown timer, I learn the names of the yoga poses and I can also find ways to contact an in-person yoga studio

## Design

### Design Choices

### Typography

Google Fonts were used to import Poppins and Oxygen fonts into styles.css. A sans-serif generic font was chosen as a back-up. These were chosen as they are easy to read and sans-serif fonts are common in modern website design.

### Color

Since the theme for this game is energising Vinyasa yoga I chose bright colors that give the user an energetic feeling. I also kept accessibility in mind when choosing colors and I used a color blind friendly palette for inspiration. Colors were adapted from palettes generated using [Venngage's accessible color palette generator](https://venngage.com/tools/accessible-color-palette-generator).

#### Primary accessible color palette

The main colors I am taking from the primary color palette are: White / Purple / Yellow

#### Secondary accessible color palette

The main color I am taking from the secondary color palette is: Pink

#### HTML validation

#### CSS validation

#### JS Hint

### Accessibility and Lighthouse

### Manual testing

#### Responsiveness of features tested using Chrome DevTools

#### Browser compatibility testing

#### Testing all links on the site

### Feature testing table

### User story testing

### Fixed bugs

- Height was specified in header style and the content then spilled over to the next element. This was fixed by removing the specific height and then the header height just changed automatically to fit the content which was much better.

### Unfixed bugs

### Supported screens and browsers

#### Screens

- iPhone SE, 375px wide. Also looks good down to 300px according to devtools
