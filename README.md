## Purpose of the project

Yoga Flip is a version of the classic card memory game. It provides value to a user of any age through an educational aspect. This game gives the name of the yoga pose shown on the cards, after each successful match. There is a bonus challenge feature to this game where the user can click the 'challenge' button at any time during the game and get a random pose shown to them and they are challenged to do the pose for 20 seconds if their fitness allows. There are also social links in the footer of the main game page to encourage the user to connect with the yoga studio business, which offers in-person classes. The color theme of yoga flip was specifically chosen to provide feel-good and energizing emotions. Bright anchor colors were chosen. These are; purple, pink and white. The whole theme of this project is based around energising Vinyasa yoga.

### Typography

### Color

Since the theme for this game is energising Vinyasa yoga I chose bright colors that give the user an energetic feeling. I also kept accessibility in mind when choosing colors and I used a color blind friendly palette for inspiration. Colors were adapted from palettes generated using [Venngage's accessible color palette generator](https://venngage.com/tools/accessible-color-palette-generator).

#### Primary accessible color palette

The main colors I am taking from the primary color palette are: White / Purple / Green
