## Purpose of the project

Yoga Flip is a version of the classic card memory game. It provides value to a user of any age through an educational aspect. The educational aspect is that the game gives the name of the yoga pose shown on the cards, after each successful match. Therefore, the user is learning the name of each yoga pose as they are playing the game. The game is also challenging, because the player is playing against a countdown timer. When the timer reaches zero the grid playing area fades away and a 'Time Out!' slogan appears. There are also social links in the footer of the main game page to encourage the user to connect with a yoga studio business, which offers in-person classes. The color theme of yoga flip was specifically chosen to provide feel-good and energizing emotions. Bright anchor colors were chosen. These are; purple, yellow, light pink, bright pink and bright green. These colors were also inspired by accessible color palettes. The whole theme of this project is based around energising Vinyasa yoga.

## Design

### Design Choices

### Typography

Google Fonts were used to import Poppins and Oxygen fonts into styles.css. A sans-serif generic font was chosen as a back-up. These were chosen as they are easy to read and sans-serif fonts are common in modern website design.

### Color

Since the theme for this game is energising Vinyasa yoga I chose bright colors that give the user an energetic feeling. I also kept accessibility in mind when choosing colors and I used a color blind friendly palette for inspiration. Colors were adapted from palettes generated using [Venngage's accessible color palette generator](https://venngage.com/tools/accessible-color-palette-generator).

#### Primary accessible color palette

The main colors I am taking from the primary color palette are: White / Purple / Yellow

## Testing

### Code validation

#### HTML validation

#### CSS validation

#### JS Hint

### Accessibility and Lighthouse

### Manual testing

#### Responsiveness of features tested using Chrome DevTools

#### Browser compatibility testing

#### Testing all links on the site

### Feature testing table

### User story testing

### Fixed bugs

- Height was specified in header style and the content then spilled over to the next element. This was fixed by removing the specific height and then the header height just changed automatically to fit the content which was much better.

### Unfixed bugs

### Supported screens and browsers

#### Screens

- iPhone SE, 375px wide. Also looks good down to 300px according to devtools
- iPad Mini, 768px wide
- Nest Hub Max, 1280px wide
