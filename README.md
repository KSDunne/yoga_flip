## Purpose of the project

Yoga Flip is a version of the classic card memory game. It provides value to a user of any age through an educational aspect. This game gives the name of the yoga pose shown on the cards, after each successful match. There is a bonus challenge feature to this game where the user can click the 'challenge' button at any time during the game and get a random pose shown to them and they are challenged to do the pose for 20 seconds if their fitness allows. There are also social links in the footer of the main game page to encourage the user to connect with the yoga studio business, which offers in-person classes. The color theme of yoga flip was specifically chosen to provide feel-good and energizing emotions. Bright anchor colors were chosen. These are; purple, pink and white. The whole theme of this project is based around energising Vinyasa yoga.

## User experience (UX)

### Key project goals

### Target audience

### User requirements and expectations

## User stories

* As a site visitor, I am first assessing if this is an intuitive and eye-catching game that I would like to play
* As a site visitor, I will initaially see a grid style game with 16 cards. I will initailly be able to see the back-side of the cards
* As a site visitor, I will be able to click two cards at a time. They will flip over and stay flipped over if I have matched them
* As a site visitor, I will see that the timer starts when I flip the first card
* As a site visitor, I will see that a move is logged when the second card is flipped
* As a site visitor, I will see that the timer stops once I finish matching all of the 16 cards on the grid
* As a site visitor, I will be able to click a button that says "challenge" to get a random yoga pose to try at home for fun. This will pop up via a modal.
* As a site visitor, I will be able to close this modal whenever I want
* As a site visitor, I will be able to click a "reset" button at any time during the game to flip all the cards over to start again

## Design

### Design Choices

### Typography

### Color

Since the theme for this game is energising Vinyasa yoga I chose bright colors that give the user an energetic feeling. I also kept accessibility in mind when choosing colors and I used a color blind friendly palette for inspiration. Colors were adapted from palettes generated using [Venngage's accessible color palette generator](https://venngage.com/tools/accessible-color-palette-generator).

#### Primary accessible color palette

The main colors I am taking from the primary color palette are: White / Purple / Green
